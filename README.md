<!-- OVERVIEW -->

## Overview

![screenshot](./webroot/images/photograf-screenshot.png)
 
1.  My demo can be seen by following this [link](https://photograph-rinon.netlify.app/)
1.  Some experience:
  - Building an existing website of a photographic company. This is actually the homepage with small details on the pages that the whole website has. 

1.   What I have learned and improved:
  - Working with image sliders is one of the new skills that I get from building this website. Apart from that, I learned how to use a function to generate fonts with sass.
  
1. Wisdom to share:
The best way to improve is to be motivated and always confident to face challenges no matter how difficult it will be.
